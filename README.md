This repo has the file [run_analysis.R] (https://github.com/csacristan/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data---Course-Projet/blob/master/run_analysis.R), and its purpose is load raw data store in different files in a clean, tidy data frame. After that, the data is grouped in order to calculate the mean of the values and the results are show in the output (View method).

It's **necessary** that the working directory has set in the **main directory where the data is in**. That's it, the directory has to be similar to:

  - [DIR]   *test*      
  - [DIR]   *train* 
  - activity_labels.txt
  - features.txt
  - features.info
  - README.txt
  - run_analysis.R

There is also a [code_book.pdf] (https://github.com/csacristan/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data---Course-Projet/blob/master/code_book.pdf) file, where the variables used by the data frame are described
